# Vendored crates

Permissively licensed crates carried with small patches. Each directory keeps the upstream
licence files unchanged. Remove the vendored copy once upstream releases the fix. Vendoring
copyleft code is never allowed.

| Crate | Version | Licence | Patches | From |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| winit | 0.30.13 | Apache-2.0 | **Android:** (1) each touch's tool type (finger, stylus, eraser, mouse, palm) is put in bits 32..40 of `Touch::id`, so the app can tell the S Pen from a finger and ignore a resting palm; (2) a mouse, or a touchpad in pointer mode, is delivered as cursor, button and wheel events instead of touches (hover, right-click, wheel); (3) a touchpad's two-finger swipe scrolls and its pinch zooms. **Desktop:** IME and window-placement fixes for Windows, macOS, X11 and Wayland (ports of winit#4341, #4587, #4650, #4727, #4746, #4747, #4748). Each patch is marked `PdfCraft patch:` in the source. | Copied unchanged from WordCraft's and PdfCraft's Android ports (`Azurehawke/wordcraft` and `Azurehawke/pdfcraft`, `android` branch, `vendor/winit`), where the patches are written and tested |

The Android patches are what `apps/gridcraft-android/src/tablet.rs` relies on: without them every
touch, the S Pen's included, would look like a finger.
